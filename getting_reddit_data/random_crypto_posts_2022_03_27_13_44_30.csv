He suggested that Bitcoin can be manipulated by ‚Äúwhales‚Äù who agree to quickly and in large quantity exchange coinage to pump the price, as has been done on the stock exchange and is a big Nono by the SEC.

I have a pretty good understanding of blockchain and Bitcoin in general, but dident have a good reply as to why this is not potentially a problem.

I see that mine updated by itself.

Brave browser is one of the best browser there is. And you want to know why? Because it's built on pure blockchain foundations. You install it on your PC or phone, create a wallet and then bam! You get paid in BAT (Brave's cryptocurrency) for every ad that you receive. And the ad is not annoying at all. It's just a notification that you don't need to click to obtain your BAT.

Another extremely good thing about Brave is that it blocks trackers (it shows on the front page when you open it how many trackers it has blocked) and it has a built in adblocker for those pesky pop-ups and ads (except Brave's ads, of course).

It also saves you data usage and hours in time saved. For example my front page tells me that Brave blocked 136 059 trackers and ads, saved me 3.17 GB bandwidth and 1.9 hours. Thanks, Brave team!

So you have this: Brave, a blockchain decentralized browser that pays you in BAT for using it, blocks trackers, ads, gives you time and more bandwidth vs. Chrome that literally shits on you, stealing your data and what not.

I highly recommend it because it's also fast. You choose what browser you want to use, but from first hearing about Brave I never used another browser since except this good boy.

Cheers!

Edit: as some people mentioned. Brave is not a decentralized browser. My mistake. But the team behind it is the same as the one behind BAT, a decentralized blockchain token.",1648373465.0

I personally don't trust that the backing is from a institutional group with a lot of unknown hands in the pot.
VC Firm: Andreessen Horowitz (a16z)
AUM: $18.8B (pre-launch of Apes)
I realize that they weren't the ones that created, but instead funded the creators(Yuga Labs). I just think it's not within my comfort zone.
I haven't been able to find any information about the founders having coding experience or even what their previous jobs were. Feel free to list their experiences in the comments.
With the creation of Ape Coin, this could be a project that will stay, but I fear it may be only hype due to lack of experience and interests from the VC firm making the situation too big to handle. Some of the yields described by people for when the meta verse goes live for the Apes projects, makes this feel unsustainable.
I might be tripping, but this reminds me of some other projects from late 2017/early 2018 that went bust and decimated the market.",1648376325.0

Although it made a few attempts before they quickly dipped back down.

This time it has reached the barrier and not only stayed steady but has slightly been trending upwards. Also this time the alts have finally been pumping up with it after dipping far harder throughout 2022 than BTC. I can only imagine that the big money is being preferentially targeted towards these undervalued alts at the present.

However, the alts are quickly reaching the point where they are even with their drop from ATH as BTC is. Some people are calling for this to be the sign that a huge crash is coming but I believe that it's more likely that once the alts have caught up that the 'big money' is going to go back to pushing BTC hard.

That gave me around 208 weeks.

Then I checked the end price of each day (end price of ""currenct"" day means start p¬¥rice of ""next"" day)

That gave me the following results:

&#x200B;

|Weekday|Total|Gain|Loss|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Sunday|209|109 (52%)|100 (48%)|

|Friday|209|112 (54%)|97 (46%)|
|Saturday|209|125 (60%)|84 (40%)|

How to read it?

Saturday having 60% ""Gain"" means 60% of the Saturdays price ended up being higher at the end of the day than at the beggining (Friday night).

Thursday having 54% ""Loss"" means 54% of the Thursdays price ends being lower at the end of the day than tha the beggining (Wednesday night)

Don't know what to do with this info, but found it intesting. Maybe instead of daily traders we get weekly trades?

I recently lost a transaction because I didn't know what needed to be included.",5,tpr1bq,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tpr1bq/can_someone_explain_to_a_newbie_what_a_memo_is/,21,"What I‚Äôm looking for:  I‚Äôm very much a beginner in crypto, and am still puzzled by this ‚Äúmemo‚Äù thing.  I am looking more for ‚Äúhow to make sure I don‚Äôt mess up a transaction‚Äù lesson than a ‚Äúwhy it‚Äôs important‚Äù lesson, although I wouldn‚Äôt mind that as well.  YouTube and other sources haven‚Äôt been very helpful.  What I really need is (1) where to find the necessary information to put in a memo and (2) what exactly needs to be included in the memo.

Background:  I tried to move a small amount of CRO from my DEFI Wallet back to the Crypto.com wallet on the app.  Let‚Äôs not get into why or if this is good/bad.  I didn‚Äôt understand what a ‚Äúmemo‚Äù was, and just wrote a note to myself.  Long story short, the transaction never went through (include in this moment my life lesson of always trying a small transaction first).  When I contacted support, they said the transaction wasn‚Äôt going to go through because I didn‚Äôt have the correct memo, but they could undo the transaction for a flat fee of $50, which would wipe out what I was trying to transfer.  So, it‚Äôs basically lost.   I'd like to avoid this in the future.",1648408910.0
