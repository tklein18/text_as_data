He suggested that Bitcoin can be manipulated by “whales” who agree to quickly and in large quantity exchange coinage to pump the price, as has been done on the stock exchange and is a big Nono by the SEC.

I have a pretty good understanding of blockchain and Bitcoin in general, but dident have a good reply as to why this is not potentially a problem. 

Hoping someone can answer.",1648261219.0

304,Yes I am in it for the money and I don't care what people think. Cryptocurrency from the perspective of a male in his 30s.,4835,tokbqf,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tokbqf/yes_i_am_in_it_for_the_money_and_i_dont_care_what/,1066,"I've seen some discussion on this sub recently blaming some people that they are here only to make profit. To make quick money. ""Why do you care about price going up or down if you are never selling?"" and other silly arguments.


And let me tell you. Yes the majority here, is in it for the money. It's because we are screwed. The society is still expecting an average male to earn a lot of money and provide for their family etc. but people in their 30s have been f**d in the arse for the last 15 years or more. 


No wage growth, no prospects in many countries, constant financial crisis that keeps hitting and hitting us from all sides, and now inflation which will melt our savings, that is if we are lucky to have any savings in the first place, education system is a joke in most countries, crippling debts, high cost of living, rents going up and up, and so on and on, I could go on forever.


Crypto for a lot of us is the only way out, our only way to be able to afford a house or a flat in the future. So yeah, you bet I'm in it for the money and I don't give a damn what people think. Priority number one for me is to provide for my family.

Edit: Thank you for the rewards, please but don't spend money on me. Instead, please donate to Ukrainian charities:

When I was researching what cryptocurrency to buy, I decided I wanted a crypto that had the best balance possible of the following attributes:

**1. Decentralization** \- Censorship resistance is the most important aspect of cryptocurrency

**2. Environmentally friendly** \- Consume minimal wasteful energy

**3. Scalable** \- More TPS = better

**4. Fairly distributed** \- This is important to prevent creators from dumping on the buyers

**5. Fast** \- Faster transactions are more convenient than slow transactions.

**6. Low transfer fees** \- Cheaper fees to send = better

**7. Low inflation** \- Inflation devalues existing coins and creates potential sell pressure.  It also incentivizes spending which is bad for the environment.

&#x200B;

Below is a description of Nano in regards to the above attributes:

**1.Decentralization**

Nano has hundreds of nodes.  The below image shows the decentralization of the bitcoin mining pools.

https://preview.redd.it/oanw3jskzrp81.jpg?width=715&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dcf0c42ba2ca00dfc9c4bbb34d2e31dbb0e10eb4

And this image shows the Nakomoto coefficient of Nano.

**2.Environmentally friendly**

Nano is as environmentally friendly as they come.  Nano does not have mining.  Below is a visualization of Nano’s power consumption compared to Bitcoins.

**3.Scalable**

Nano does not have a hardwired limit on scalability (aka transactions per second).  Instead, Nano’s transactions per second are limited by hardware and bandwidth.

**4.Fairly distributed**

[Nano’s distribution](https://blog.nano.org/the-nano-faucet-c99e18ae1202) was not perfect, but it was very close. 95% of the Nano supply was given away for free for solving captchas.  Approximately 5% was reserved for the development of Nano.  It is estimated that about .2% of the Nano supply is still in the development fund.  It is extremely important to have a fair distribution.  Without a fair distribution, founders of cryptocurrencies could rug pull and sell the tokens they own, thus crashing the price.  This image shows just how much better Nano’s distribution is than most cryptocurrencies:

**5.Fast**

Nano transactions reach **finality** in about .3 seconds!  This is incredible.  If you deposit Nano to an exchange, most exchanges will let you instantly trade and withdraw the funds.  This is unlike a lot of cryptocurrencies which pretend to be instant, but exchanges know they can’t trust the funds until x confirmations, which takes anywhere from seconds, to minutes, to hours, depending on the currency.

**6.Low transfer fees**

Nano is feeless!  Here is a visualization that compares Nano’s fees to other coins.

**7.Low inflation**

Nano has no inflation.  This is phenomenal.  Unlike most PoW and PoS coins which constantly have new coins getting minted, no new Nano will ever be minted.  This is phenomenal because at $40K per Bitcoin, $36 million dollars in Bitcoin is minted every single day.  A lot of this Bitcoin has to be sold to pay for mining costs.  This is constant sell pressure on Bitcoin’s price which Nano does not have!

Below is an image that compares Nano’s inflation (and other features) to other coins.

One complaint I have heard about Nano is that it does not have smart contracts.  This was an intentional design feature of Nano.  By being simple, Nano is able to have faster transactions and less chance of exploitation (to this day, Nano has never had a double spend).  I also personally believe decentralized finance is the number 1 use case of crypto (it is Bitcoin’s sole use case), and Nano does it better than any other cryptocurrency.

**Disclaimer:**

I did my best to post accurate information.  If I made any errors, please let me know.  This is not investment advice.

**Edit 1:**

One of the main concerns people posted is that since Nano is feeless, people are not incentivized to run nodes.  This is incorrect.  Bitcoin has mining fees and miners are paid to mine bitcoin.  However, Bitcoin also has nodes and Bitcoin node operators are paid no fees (they get none of the mining reward).  Yet, thousands of Bitcoin nodes are run by people to verify the ledger.  Nano nodes, like Bitcoin nodes, also verify the ledger.  Since running a node is a way to verify your holdings, businesses and people are incentivized to run them.  Just like with Bitcoin, finding enough people to run nodes has been a non-issue for Nano.

Another thing I want to discuss is Bitgrail, which has come up in the posts below.  When Nano started out, one of the first exchanges to list it was Bitgrail.  Bitgrail ended up being a corrupt operation as the founder stole a lot of people’s Nano.  This had nothing to do with Nano as a currency.  However, it happened right after Nano’s initial growth, and many argue crashed Nano’s price as Bitgrail was the main exchange Nano was traded on.  I believe that even though Nano had the unfortunate event of being first listed on a corrupt exchange, Nano fundamentals are now better than ever.

When I was researching what cryptocurrency to buy, I decided I wanted a crypto that had the best balance possible of the following attributes:

**1. Decentralization** \- Censorship resistance is the most important aspect of cryptocurrency

**2. Environmentally friendly** \- Consume minimal wasteful energy

**3. Scalable** \- More TPS = better

**4. Fairly distributed** \- This is important to prevent creators from dumping on the buyers

**5. Fast** \- Faster transactions are more convenient than slow transactions.

**6. Low transfer fees** \- Cheaper fees to send = better

**7. Low inflation** \- Inflation devalues existing coins and creates potential sell pressure.  It also incentivizes spending which is bad for the environment.

&#x200B;

Below is a description of Nano in regards to the above attributes:

**1.Decentralization**

Nano has hundreds of nodes.  The below image shows the decentralization of the bitcoin mining pools.

https://preview.redd.it/oanw3jskzrp81.jpg?width=715&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dcf0c42ba2ca00dfc9c4bbb34d2e31dbb0e10eb4

**2.Environmentally friendly**

Nano is as environmentally friendly as they come.  Nano does not have mining.  Below is a visualization of Nano’s power consumption compared to Bitcoins.

https://preview.redd.it/mpxrlc0ozrp81.png?width=1155&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad3981cde3af2df12ffc726fef8ccbae4100322a

**3.Scalable**

Nano does not have a hardwired limit on scalability (aka transactions per second).  Instead, Nano’s transactions per second are limited by hardware and bandwidth.

**4.Fairly distributed**

[Nano’s distribution](https://blog.nano.org/the-nano-faucet-c99e18ae1202) was not perfect, but it was very close. 95% of the Nano supply was given away for free for solving captchas.  Approximately 5% was reserved for the development of Nano.  It is estimated that about .2% of the Nano supply is still in the development fund.  It is extremely important to have a fair distribution.  Without a fair distribution, founders of cryptocurrencies could rug pull and sell the tokens they own, thus crashing the price.  This image shows just how much better Nano’s distribution is than most cryptocurrencies:

He stressed that such issues should be resolved only jointly with the Central Bank.

“Without a doubt, such issues can only be resolved jointly with the Central Bank in order to assess the risks that cryptocurrencies create for Russia’s money circulation,” Mishustin said during a meeting with members of the Liberal Democratic Party.

He added that measures should be taken to further regulate mining. The prime minister recalled that last month the government approved the concept of the Ministry of Finance, which outlined these issues in detail.

In the concept of the department, it is proposed to carry out all operations with cryptocurrencies through Russian banks, identify the holders of crypto wallets and divide customers into qualified and unqualified investors.

At the same time, the Bank of Russia is actively advocating a ban on the issuance and circulation of private digital currencies in the country. On February 18, the regulator presented a draft law, which provides for a ban on the organization of the issuance of cryptocurrency and its circulation, as well as on the dissemination of information about it. The project also prohibits banks and other financial market participants from owning private digital currencies.

In a socialist financial system, both losses and gains are socialized, while capitalistic economies socialize losses and privatize gains; this happens through government bailouts, stimulus, and inflation. While it may seem like business as usual, inflation has an inherently compounding effect, and when left in the control of trusted entities, such as political systems and corporations, will always lead to a corrupted politico-economic system. Fiat money is the tool that enables this self-destructive cycle.

Fiat is derived from a Latin word meaning “it shall be.” To add to the Latin definition, fiat currency is not backed by anything, throughout history governments have moved from gold backed currencies in order to finance wars and have greater control on inflation.

While there are many comparisons to make, Nero-era economics stands to be the best example of what can happen with an economy built around fiat. Nero came to power in 54 AD, and the wheels that would cause the collapse of the Roman Empire were set in motion.  He reduced the silver content in Roman coins little by little, to increase supply. By year 217, the silver content in the Roman coins was reduced by almost half, replaced with copper. Less than two decades later, the ‘Crisis of the Third Century’ began, and the debasement of Roman currency continued. Fueled by war, political assassinations, civil unrest, and food shortages, the silver content eventually dropped to 2% by the year 300 AD. It was to the point that coins in circulation would eventually have the silver wear off, revealing the copper underneath. Less than 100 years later the Empire would collapse.

Over time, any amount of trust given to an entity to govern currency will result in corruption. I am not arguing government is inherently bad, but when given the option between a popular social initiative and an unpopular tax hike, fiat enables governments to choose a third option, move forward with the social initiative and finance through inflation. A trustful relationship with government and financial institutions assumes those in charge are insusceptible to human pressures, which is the riskiest assumption to make.

In the United States, the Gold Standard was abandoned in 1933 and replaced by an adjustable dollar to gold conversion rate. Over the years, the conversion rate grew exponentially, until it finally ended in 1971 during the Nixon administration, analogically reducing the silver content of the Roman currency till it’s completely moved from a store of value, to currency value the government has deemed “it shall be,” to fiat.

The majority of the world has a vested interest in the success of the US Dollar. In fact, in 1945, 44 countries decided to adopt the dollar as the official reserve currency of the world via the Bretton Woods Agreement. So, when considering foreign exchange indexes and relative inflation, you must consider the value of many of the world’s currencies are based on their US Dollar reserves, among other smaller factors. The Bretton Woods Agreement was a major success for the United States and guaranteed a level of monetary stability. This dynamic creates a political rift among other world powers, such as China and Russia, who would like to not only enjoy the same stability, but also want independence from the US Dollar. In 2018, China created the petroyuan, a gold backed currency meant to be used in oil trade as an alternative to the petrodollar. More recently, China has increased its gold imports to the point of typically surpassing the US on a year-over-year basis, further strengthening its reserves and adversarial currency. 

China has a small Achilles heel if it moves to debase the US Dollar, Hong Kong. Hong Kong is one of the major financial hubs of the world, hence the fight for autonomy. The Hong Kong Dollar is backed by nearly 600B USD, making its economy reliant on the stability of the dollar. However, in 1984, Margaret Thatcher signed a treaty with China, outlining the assimilation back into mainland that would finish in 2047, meaning by 2047 Hong Kong will likely abandon the Hong Kong dollar and adopt the Chinese Yuan. As evident in recent conflicts in Hong Kong, and the global reaction that followed, China seems to want to speed up this assimilation and potentially remove the US dollar liability.

With advancements in technology, we now have the power to remove trust from governments and financial institutions. China is not trying to move away from global dependence on the dollar for brand recognition, it’s due to a lack of trust in the entities that control the dollar. If the shoe was on the other foot, the lack of trust would still exist, and other world powers would be moving to debase Chinese currency. The only answer, without repeating historical cycles, is an uninflatable supply of money with an auditable ledger. 

Bitcoin will be used as a tool in an economic war, as a crutch for countries to adopt as China destabilizes the dollar. However, Bitcoin is not the answer to everything, it’s deflationary by nature – 4% of total supply is lost every year. Bitcoin finds its perfect use case as a stable trade currency, which may be difficult to think about if you look at the price swings of the cryptocurrency indexes, but with adoption comes stability. With Bitcoin, nobody needs to trust the US, or any other country, to keep inflation in check and the impact of leveraging currency as a tool of war is mitigated. 

Not only does Bitcoin solve currency manipulation at the global level, but the concept can be applied to domestic issues. Bitcoin will not work as a consumer level currency, due to the debt-driven nature of much of the world. A secondary currency, potentially issued by central banks, will be necessary for day-to-day transactions, loans, and other lines of credit; this sidesteps the deflationary aspect of Bitcoin. How do we implement a trustless relationship with a central bank digital currency? Algorithmic inflation. We need a system that will use a deflationary store of value, like Bitcoin, coupled with an autonomous inflationary currency for debt and day to day transactions.

For now, it’s a race against time. The average age of a cryptocurrency investor is 37, which is fairly young when compared to the average age of a US Senator, 63. It’s incredibly difficult to legislate something that the Senators have little understanding of. As adoption continues, so will global politico-economic escalations, which is why we need to focus on educating people on the inherent risks of a fiat-based trustful relationship with our government, before we follow the same path many societies have suffered in the past.",1648344275.0

I have listed many of the ones that are commonly used. Depending on how many you know you will be in one tier or another.

The tiers are made based on concepts complexity and the frequency they're used. Of course, **take this as a game**. On the last levels there is a limit because I could've added up to hundreds of terms

A fantastic way to trick yourself into working around this and not letting yourself invest too much is to simply tell yourself that the money you put into crypto you will never see ever again. 

This way you aren’t tricking yourself into “well this $100 is going to turn into $10,000 and I’ll be golden” and then continually put in $100 daily and end up with all your money gone. Doing it this way means that *any* money you get in return is a positive. You invested $50 but 6 months later deposit $25? For all your budget knows, you just gained $25 and the $50 you spent 6 months ago is gone.

I don’t put my crypto portfolio (or stock portfolio for that matter) into my budgeting app. I have a set budget every month for crypto and that’s all I spend, I tell myself it’s a bill or something fun and that the money I just spent, I’ll never see again.

So, what the hell should I do with this? And my emotions?

Well - emotions have no place whatsoever in investing, they will only work against you.

In the coldest sense, if you are in a project for the long haul the opposite of your emotional response is probably best (buy when everybody is selling and it’s low, sell a bit when it’s high) - but obviously that’s vanilla and near impossible to execute.

So how do we avoid this? DCA! What does that mean? Dollar cost averaging or basically a committed regular investment.

If you truly AREN’T in this for a unicorn “quick buck” then if you invest consistently (per month set £/€/$ amount) at the same rate, you aren’t trying to predict intraday swings and instead you just believe in a few years + it’ll be higher.

Much less stressful, requires no intelligence short of the obviously disclaimer - be careful which projects you back and stay away from moonshots and sh*tcoins.

Customers will only see their interest paying continuously shrink, and will have to manually look up interest rates, only to see it keep falling.

392,A question for college work,0,tpfxtq,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tpfxtq/a_question_for_college_work/,14,"Hi everyone. I wanted to ask few questions and get few perspectives on a crypto-mining related  topic. In one of my courses for college, we(my classmates) wanted to see if crypto-mining mining generates enough heat that can be introduced into any District Heating systems of countries such as Nordics. So, 

1. If you were to build a huge mining farm, would you want additional revenue source by selling the heat?
2. Would you want your factory/farm to be green or clean? 

Edit: Forgot to add a few important info:

3. Crypto farms require cooling. So in the process of cooling(either by conduction of convection) the heat is removed. We are assuming this heat can be sold. 

4. We found that crypto mining generates heat around 60Degree C and if we can extract the maximum matter from it, we would be having something that is 50-60Degree C and that can be sent to district heating. 

5. For a farm owner, installing any heat extraction system will be no different than the cooling system they purchase. 


Also please, let me know what you think about this large scale heat extraction from crypto-mining. 

Thank you.",1648370943.0

I don't want a money grab or a paywall; I want a universal communication system for games.

A few years ago, I played Call of Duty Blacksops 2. It was the pinacle of my teenage years and I a few buddies, and I grinded the game and got all of the gold skins and achievements. This took a few hundred hours. Now, the game is dead, and I can no longer look at those skins and achievements. I can't play with them, and I can't display them on my Steam profile.

Now, I recently started playing Call of Duty mobile, and I really love the game, but now I need to unlock and grind all of the same skins again. This isn't actually a problem, but it got me thinking. Once they abandon this game, make a new one, and I will need to do it all over again.

What I want is for these skins and achievements to be NFTs. Once I unlock the skin, I can mint it to my ETH or whatever account and hold it there. If the company or game goes under, I still have them. I can display and hold them as I wish. Once a new game is made, I should be able to import my NFTs , play with them , display them as legacy skins, and maybe unlock the new ones again.

Now, r/buttcoin will say: ""Yes, but wHY hAvE nFtS thEn??"". Well, you know what. All NFTs do not have value. I never want to sell these and I don't want to buy yours. I want to have them. I want to unlock and own them. I want the blockchain to act as a standard for how skins are communicated and transferred between games.

By using a blockchain, a standard communication protocol can be made because how things are now, Battlefield 5, and Call of Duty games will ""never"" speak to each other. And bug corporations will exclude other indie developers from their communication systems. By having an open source standard, it is free and open to use for all.

These unlocked skins will have no monetary value for me. Others can buy and sell them; I don't want to make money from this. This isn't even play to earn. I just want to own my achievements. I am actually turned off from grinding the new game, knowing that I no longer have access to assets of a game that I bought and owned 10 years ago.

Boomers, you have your holloahoop collection and baseball cards. Allow me to display my skins on my steam profile and own them. It is exactly the same; mine is just digital. Your frisbees and stupid baseball cards have no value to me. I will never buy a stupid furbie or whatever those 90s dolls were called, but for you, they are worth 10k USD. My skins have no monetary value. So aren't you the ones collecting and attaching monetary value to something stupid?",1648372979.0

800,How I want NFTs used in games as a gamer.,19,tpgcwb,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tpgcwb/how_i_want_nfts_used_in_games_as_a_gamer/,49,"Firstly, let me state that I am supportive of the backlash NFTs are getting by gamers. I don't want a money grab or a paywall; I want a universal communication system for games.

A few years ago, I played Call of Duty Blacksops 2. It was the pinacle of my teenage years and I a few buddies, and I grinded the game and got all of the gold skins and achievements. This took a few hundred hours. Now, the game is dead, and I can no longer look at those skins and achievements. I can't play with them, and I can't display them on my Steam profile.

Now, I recently started playing Call of Duty mobile, and I really love the game, but now I need to unlock and grind all of the same skins again. This isn't actually a problem, but it got me thinking. Once they abandon this game, make a new one, and I will need to do it all over again.

What I want is for these skins and achievements to be NFTs. Once I unlock the skin, I can mint it to my ETH or whatever account and hold it there. If the company or game goes under, I still have them. I can display and hold them as I wish. Once a new game is made, I should be able to import my NFTs , play with them , display them as legacy skins, and maybe unlock the new ones again.

Now, r/buttcoin will say: ""Yes, but wHY hAvE nFtS thEn??"". Well, you know what. All NFTs do not have value. I never want to sell these and I don't want to buy yours. I want to have them. I want to unlock and own them. I want the blockchain to act as a standard for how skins are communicated and transferred between games.

By using a blockchain, a standard communication protocol can be made because how things are now, Battlefield 5, and Call of Duty games will ""never"" speak to each other. And bug corporations will exclude other indie developers from their communication systems. By having an open source standard, it is free and open to use for all.

These unlocked skins will have no monetary value for me. Others can buy and sell them; I don't want to make money from this. This isn't even play to earn. I just want to own my achievements. I am actually turned off from grinding the new game, knowing that I no longer have access to assets of a game that I bought and owned 10 years ago.

Boomers, you have your holloahoop collection and baseball cards. Allow me to display my skins on my steam profile and own them. It is exactly the same; mine is just digital. Your frisbees and stupid baseball cards have no value to me. I will never buy a stupid furbie or whatever those 90s dolls were called, but for you, they are worth 10k USD. My skins have no monetary value. So aren't you the ones collecting and attaching monetary value to something stupid?",1648372979.0

I see that mine updated by itself.

Brave browser is one of the best browser there is. And you want to know why? Because it's built on pure blockchain foundations. You install it on your PC or phone, create a wallet and then bam! You get paid in BAT (Brave's cryptocurrency) for every ad that you receive. And the ad is not annoying at all. It's just a notification that you don't need to click to obtain your BAT.

Another extremely good thing about Brave is that it blocks trackers (it shows on the front page when you open it how many trackers it has blocked) and it has a built in adblocker for those pesky pop-ups and ads (except Brave's ads, of course).

It also saves you data usage and hours in time saved. For example my front page tells me that Brave blocked 136 059 trackers and ads, saved me 3.17 GB bandwidth and 1.9 hours. Thanks, Brave team!

So you have this: Brave, a blockchain decentralized browser that pays you in BAT for using it, blocks trackers, ads, gives you time and more bandwidth vs. Chrome that literally shits on you, stealing your data and what not.

I highly recommend it because it's also fast. You choose what browser you want to use, but from first hearing about Brave I never used another browser since except this good boy.

Cheers!

Apparently, there was some malware on my Windows 10 pc that changes any bitcoin address to this one:

""bc1qn0r06gtwlamffet49fph9jnm9u2e2ylx5ns7qc"".

I sold a Google Play card on a legit website for bitcoin and didn't even notice that i put the wrong address. I was confused as it said that the transaction was complete and there were no bitcoins on my electrum wallet (this is my first bitcoin transaction btw). After some time of being confused i realised that the address is wrong and then i tried coping the right one and it was pasting the one noted above! I was still confused, thought at first that the c on the keyboard doesn't function properly or that windows automaticaly doesn't copy as it thinks it's the same text or smth. But then i realised that this may is a malware... I googled about it and there exist malware like this one... Then googled about the address and it has a complete history of transactions and others have reported it for scamming and issues like this one.

Funny thing is that i don't even know how long i had this malware on my computer and was focused on not getting scammed selling my gift card haha. Thankfully, the amound was only 25$ but im still surprised.

I am now scanning my computer to find the malware, it might take some hours, and then will try to analyze it. I don't think any other password is hacked as i don't believe there is data being send from it but you never know... After this i am ofcourse removing windows from my computer forever and changing every single password i have.",1648380119.0

I understand that the deflation will be variable but I can’t help but question how this would work exactly.

Would you buy a cup of coffee with something that you know is deflationary? I know I would think twice (or 10 times) before exchanging my eth for any other token, or even before sending it out of my wallet at all, if I knew about its deflationary properties.

I understand (and endorse) economies based on capped supplies, like having dollars backed by BTC. But how exactly can an economy function on top of a deflationary asset, when so many ETH holder will likely avoid doing anything with their ETH other than hodl? Unlike BTC, ETH’s value is contingent on the token being involved in smart contracts, and generally being used akin to gas for cars, no?

Let’s not forget that a huge driver behind investing in general is the fear of having your cash lose value over time. How can economic development be stimulated when you know your “cash” will accrue value over time instead?",1648382790.0

186,Banano: Great tipping culture and helps medical research!,26,tpiqhn,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tpiqhn/banano_great_tipping_culture_and_helps_medical/,22,"# Overview

Banano is a meme coin based off Nano. It has super fast transactions, is environmentally friendly (no mining) and is feeless.

These qualities make Banano a great coin for tipping, which is heavily encouraged in its 37k+ strong Reddit community.

There is also wrapped Banano (wBAN) on the Polygon network.

# Medical Research

Banano doesn't have traditional mining. Instead, if people contribute their computing power towards [Folding@Home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en-GB), they will receive Banano payouts daily. Folding@Home folds proteins to advance medical research, so not only are you receiving extra BAN, you also help the world!

# JungleTV

[JungleTV](https://jungletv.live/) lets you watch videos and be rewarded in Banano. You can also put your own video in the queue for a small amount of Banano, promoting your own hobbies/interests!

# Faucets

Banano has many faucets where you can get Banano for free. [Here is a fairly comprehensive list.](https://np.reddit.com/r/banano/comments/nyb4ch/faucet_list/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

This is a great way to tip your toes into the Banano ecosystem. I highly recommend [Kalium](https://kalium.banano.cc/) as the go to wallet.

# Downsides

I'm not going to pretend that everything is perfect with Banano. As far as I can tell, there are two main problems with Banano

1. It is quite centralised. The original founders hold a decent % of the supply. This is improving all the time with airdrops, Fold@Home, and faucets, but it is still an issue.
2. It isn't listed on any big exchanges. Banano's biggest exchanges are CoinEx and Hotbit, which pale in size compared to Coinbase/Binance/Kraken etc.

# Market Cap

Banano has a very low market cap of $21 million (fully diluted). In June 2021, it hit a market cap high of $62 million.

As far as meme coins go, this seems to be an extremely undervalued crypto.

But what point some of you are missing is that not every low mc crypto is designed as a gambling coin.

Zilliqa: From its ATH it was down more than 75%. It was sitting on 600M MC. I've been observing the coin, the team, and the development. What they were missing is marketing. The thing which ETH is about to implement we call SHARDING, Zilliqa has already been doing this for years now. It has just hit  1B MC and has more in store when we see a massive bull run. Your investment of 100 dollars would've given u 3000 Zils that would've been 300 now. Good coin, best bet, low risk, low market cap gem(not now), YESS.  


Cartesi: Not taken off yet but this is yet another gem that has a lot of potentials. Yes, it's a low MC coin but investing in it would be more of a legit investment than of gambling, and the team behind CTSI, tbh is one of the best-performing teams with so many partnerships with other great companies.

Almost tripled my investment and thought that I can easily quadruple... 
You know the greed feeling... 
Then after the release of Smart Contracts I fell almost triple my initial investment ... 
But kept on buying ... Thinking it won't go so much lower ... 
Last time when they predicted falling below 1$ actually it stopped at 3$ and above ... 
So - as for now I continue buying the dip and am happy of it ... 
Already lowered my buying price much
And for now I am happy that ADA is not abandoned ship ... Already many Dapps and DeFi's on the track ... 
But where are those all people who was shilling and telling that Cardano will overtake Ether and so one ...? 
The tech is still there ...

The scammer was able to get millions of dollars in stolen funds. However, the police in Manchester has already returned more than $25 million to affected users all over the world.


We have heard many times how hackers are able to steal users’ funds from crypto holders all over the world. It is clear that decentralization and freedom to use digital currencies comes with large responsibilities. At the same time, the risk of using new protocols and DeFi (decentralized finance) solutions also requires crypto holders to pay close attention to what they do.

In this case, scammers were able to steal close to $230,000 per victim from the Binance Smart Chain blockchain network. One of the protocols had been affected and many users are now waiting for their funds to be returned.

Scammers were not able to properly store and secure the stolen virtual currencies. Due to this reason, Manchester police were able to recover $25 million and give them back to the real owners of the funds. The investigation continues and the goal is to recognize as many investors as possible and return them their funds. This can take yet some time, but law enforcement agencies in the UK are already working in order to give users’ funds back.

Different reports show how scammers have been attacking people in the United Kingdom and also other countries. According to a recent report by the Treasury Committee, the government is failing to stop scammers from attacking online consumers.",1648386119.0

>… I've been in this game for years, it made me an animal  
It's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual  
A step-by-step booklet for you to get  
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back

I've been in Crypto before 2017 and these are the lessons I learned so you don't have to make the same mistakes.

>Rule Number Uno, never let no one know  
How much dough you hold cause you know  
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially  
If that man f\*cked up, get yo' ass stuck up

1.Never share how much Crypto you own because that will make you a target for scammers & hackers

&#x200B;

>Number 2, never let 'em know your next move  
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence and violence?  
Take it from your highness  
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for their bricks and chips

2. Don't give Crypto advice to others, stay low key.

&#x200B;

>Number 3, never trust no-bo-dy  
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up  
Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck  
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up

3. Don't listen to public figures and price predictions.  
They have selfish intentions, DYOR

&#x200B;

>Number 4, I know you heard this before  
Never get high on your own supply

4. Just because your portfolio is pumping, don't FOMO in a bull-run

&#x200B;

>Number 5, never sell no crack where you rest at  
I don't care if they want a ounce, tell 'em bounce!

5. Don't try to convince your social environment about Crypto

&#x200B;

>Number 6, that goddamn credit? Dead it  
You think a crackhead paying you back, shit forget it!

6. Don't do leverage trading 

&#x200B;

>7, this rule is so underrated  
Keep your family and business completely separated  
Money and blood don't mix like 2 dicks and no bitch  
Find yourself in serious shit

7. Don’t tell your family to get into crypto, they will blame you when the shit goes down.

&#x200B;

>Number 8, never keep no weight on you!  
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too

8. Don't marry a coin, have an exit strategy ready because the market is volatile and can crush your funds.

&#x200B;

>Number 9 shoulda been Number 1 to me,  
If you ain't gettin' bagged stay the f\*ck from police  
If n\*ggas think you snitchin' they ain't trying to listen  
They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'

9. Don’t forget about taxes! Make sure you record everything as to not get screwed later on

&#x200B;

>Number 10, a strong word called consignment  
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen  
If you ain't got the clientele, say ""hell no!""  
'Cause they gon' want they money rain sleet hail snow

10. Nobody knows shit so don't invest more than you can afford to lose

&#x200B;

>Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up  
If not, 24 years on the wake up  
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up  
Caretaker did your makeup, when you passed  
Your girl fucked my man Jake up, heard in three weeks  
She sniffed a whole half of cake up  
Heard she suck a good dick, and can hook a steak up  
Gotta go gotta go, more pies to bake up, word up

I can very well remember the sentiments that were flying around at that time. A whole lot of speculation about BTC and ETH hitting $100,000 and $10,000 respectively was made. 90 days later, the two top coins have danced below expectations. Not only that, every other alts followed the dip trend. It almost became a normal thing. An average crypto trader at some point was beginning to make net losses. It was even worse for folks that bought the top. Now, a lot of people are pissed off but they can’t complain.

On the other side were the minority, those who were lucky enough to learn early that investing in cryptocurrency is not just about chasing dumps and pumps. These are the guys that have maximized the incredible opportunities that come with DeFi. Yield farming, providing liquidity and lending may be strange words to a DeFi noob. However, they are currently the most logical way to earn steady passive income in the crypto space.

A lot of people are already familiar with yield generators like Aave, Compound, Curve etc. Anchor protocol is the recently popular one with 19% APY on stables. What a lot of people are yet to be familiar with is Spool, which basically acts as infrastructure middleware that offers users a way to participate in a combination of other yield aggregators while limiting risk. How cool is the sound of getting the average of the yield generating power of different yield protocols all at the same time? You are about to see that in full action as the DAO-ran project is wrapping up its Alpha release for the quarter.

For the sake of uninformed gents, Spool is simply a new form of auto-compounder. By definition, it is a kind of vault with a smart contract that automatically routes users' deposits into an array of different Yield generators in a risk-managed and yield-optimized manner.

Basically, a spool is made up of a risk model, risk tolerance and subset of yield generators. In whole, this represents a yield strategy. According to the design, there will be a lot of spools inside the protocol giving users enough flexibility to decide on the yield strategy that they are most comfortable with. Another big deal about it is that users have the option to adjust their risk tolerance and yield strategy in general before their deposits to meet a target APY. No matter how wide your appetite is, you can combine the right set of parameters to get you the yield you desire from your assets over a period of time.

It’s a very interesting thing to look forward to. The best part of it is that it’s entirely automatic. No need for constant rebalancing and protocols associated with general DeFi platforms. In addition, SPOOL token is regularly emitted to boost the yield of individual spools. This simply means that besides the APY rewards you get from getting your deposits through the yield generators, you will get additional SPOOL tokens which will be released to individual Spools based on the directives of the SPOOL DAO. This puts the DAO in a very commanding position to decide who gets the biggest rewards in SPOOL.

SPOOL, being a governance token is not required to participate and earn from the ecosystem. However, staking SPOOL secures a person’s access into the Spool DAO. Interestingly, staking SPOOL has no APY benefits but the reward is far more lucrative.

Besides the substantial performance fees that they will receive, the token stakers get voSPOOL which is accrued based on the SPOOL staked by a user. Holders of voSPOOL have the governance with a voting power that can be applied in several ways including deciding fees structure, managing treasury emission to different spools, determining risk models and strategies proposals etc.

It’s a fantastic design and there is something particular I noticed from Spool protocol’s structure. It’s quite obvious that the team assessed a lot of DeFi yield protocols and identified the gaps therein. To a major extent, what their product is offering to deliver solves a lot of the problem that we have seen with DeFi yield tools; especially with the case of poor risk models, poor UI/UX design and lack of automated solution for noobs and people with low knowledge and skill in the DeFi space.

The official development of the remarkable project started in August 2020. Now the Alpha product which is its first official release should be out soon. If there is anything to be bullish on right now, it is SPOOL.",1648387969.0

Holders of voSPOOL have the governance with a voting power that can be applied in several ways including deciding fees structure, managing treasury emission to different spools, determining risk models and strategies proposals etc.

It’s a fantastic design and there is something particular I noticed from Spool protocol’s structure. It’s quite obvious that the team assessed a lot of DeFi yield protocols and identified the gaps therein. To a major extent, what their product is offering to deliver solves a lot of the problem that we have seen with DeFi yield tools; especially with the case of poor risk models, poor UI/UX design and lack of automated solution for noobs and people with low knowledge and skill in the DeFi space.

The official development of the remarkable project started in August 2020. Now the Alpha product which is its first official release should be out soon. If there is anything to be bullish on right now, it is SPOOL.",1648387969.0

If you have counterargument, please write here so then we can give another argument of the counterargument. You can also extend the arguments further to be more polished.

I have some arguments over there of why banning Non-Custodial Wallet is a bad idea (keep the term ""unhosted"" b/c that's the term which they used). Sadly I'm not good at making arguments, so feel free to copy & paste it and make it a proper one lol.

* If the owner of the unhosted wallet are using it for illegal activity, it wouldn't make much difference if we ban it or not because they would just continue using it for illegal activity.
* Banning unhosted wallet reduces the security way less. There has been a lot of hacks on, for example, exchanges which they offer hosted wallet as well and the customer lost all their money. Also very common is that exchange can't be trusted as well, there has been cases where they were running away with our money. Unhosted wallet gives us the ability to secure the funds.
* Banning unhosted wallet is more resistant against hacker (= hardware ""unhosted"" wallet) and protect your privacy from hacker and unauthorized third parties.
* Banning unhosted wallet is like banning the leather wallet with the money on it (which... is already happening anyway I guess? lol)
* Banning unhosted wallet would hurt Web3 business a lot since most rely on ""unhosted"" wallet.
* Banning unhosted wallet would be similar as banning gold in 1934 (perhaps more context would be good here of why it didn't worked well)
* ""Unhosted Wallet"" is not a correct term. A Non-Custodial Wallet still requires an active internet connection to make transactions. It should be rather referred as ""self-hosted Wallet"" or better, just plain ""Wallet"" for non-custodial and ""Custodial-Wallet"" for custodial.
* Banning unhosted wallet is same as banning owning gold in your own house / safe.

Yes I'm well aware of it that those arguments are more or less ""their goal"" since their sole purpose for this is for having more control of our private financial purpose

I can also list the arguments here in this thread from the comments below. =)

**EDIT: Arguments from Comments below:**

* Bitcoin can't function without non-custodial/self-hosted Bitcoin Wallets because Bitcoin needs transaction fees to function properly when the block subsidy becomes negligible or zero.
* Way more than half of the nearly 19 million Bitcoin today, probably more than 70 percent, are privately held. Do lawmakers really expect that all these bitcoins around the world need to be sold, then re-bought at custodial services? This seems to come under the category of frivilous lawmaking. Can a judge force lawmakers who write frivilous laws to be personally accountable for compensation for wasting the courts time with a lack of research and understanding before making the law of the land?",1648388121.0

* Banning unhosted wallet is more resistant against hacker (= hardware ""unhosted"" wallet) and protect your privacy from hacker and unauthorized third parties.
* Banning unhosted wallet is like banning the leather wallet with the money on it (which... is already happening anyway I guess? lol)
* Banning unhosted wallet would hurt Web3 business a lot since most rely on ""unhosted"" wallet.
* Banning unhosted wallet would be similar as banning gold in 1934 (perhaps more context would be good here of why it didn't worked well)
* ""Unhosted Wallet"" is not a correct term. A Non-Custodial Wallet still requires an active internet connection to make transactions. It should be rather referred as ""self-hosted Wallet"" or better, just plain ""Wallet"" for non-custodial and ""Custodial-Wallet"" for custodial.
* Banning unhosted wallet is same as banning owning gold in your own house / safe.

Yes I'm well aware of it that those arguments are more or less ""their goal"" since their sole purpose for this is for having more control of our private financial purpose

I can also list the arguments here in this thread from the comments below. =)

**EDIT: Arguments from Comments below:**

* Bitcoin can't function without non-custodial/self-hosted Bitcoin Wallets because Bitcoin needs transaction fees to function properly when the block subsidy becomes negligible or zero.
* Way more than half of the nearly 19 million Bitcoin today, probably more than 70 percent, are privately held. Do lawmakers really expect that all these bitcoins around the world need to be sold, then re-bought at custodial services? This seems to come under the category of frivilous lawmaking. Can a judge force lawmakers who write frivilous laws to be personally accountable for compensation for wasting the courts time with a lack of research and understanding before making the law of the land?",1648388121.0

They are trying to link fiat to their chain and make it interoperable.. I'm probably not using the right words but they are trying to make it so you can connect your bank fiat directly to your wallet and just swap to their wrapped tokens.

628,330 BTC were traded worldwide using LocalBitcoin. Around 8% (27 BTC) of it were traded in Venezuela. Updating this week numbers. Monthly minimum wage still 30 USD.,17,tpl134,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tpl134/330_btc_were_traded_worldwide_using_localbitcoin/,17,"One BTC is around 200,000 Bs. (Bolivares, Venezuelan currency). 1 USD is around 4.4 USD 

As I always say, LocalBitcoin is only one of the exchanges and for sure it's not the biggest one, but it's the one that has public stats.

I think Binance is king, it lets you go from Bolivares to any crypto.

Some common questions:

&#x200B;

* **I remember the Venezuelan currency with a lot of zeroes, what happened?** Goverment (for third time since 2008) removed 6 zeroes from the currency by law, so now 1 ""current"" Bolivar was 1,000,000 ""old"" Bs (bolivar) before OCT2021.

&#x200B;

* **Was the monthly minimum wage really 2 USD monthly?** Yes, 2 USD MONTHLY! After a increase, goverment pegged it to the national ""cryptocurrency"" the Petro, that is, as today around 28 USD. Also you get a food bonus in cash of around 10 USD. In fact, the new wage was officially set at 130 Bs. monthly (and exchange rate is 1 USD = 4.4 Bs.) that is 30 USD.

&#x200B;

* **Is that enough?** No, it is not. Some NGO say a family of 5 members need AT LEAST 500 USD monthly to ""live"".

&#x200B;

* **What is the average wage?** Some measurements puts in around 90 USD monthly. A manager could be over 200 USD monthly. That puts moons income a good chunk of money here.

&#x200B;

* **What about inflation?** Slowing down, last year was only 700%, years ago it was over 1,000,000% anually.

563,330 BTC were traded worldwide using LocalBitcoin. Around 8% (27 BTC) of it were traded in Venezuela. Updating this week numbers. Monthly minimum wage still 30 USD.,19,tpl134,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tpl134/330_btc_were_traded_worldwide_using_localbitcoin/,17,"One BTC is around 200,000 Bs. (Bolivares, Venezuelan currency). 1 USD is around 4.4 USD 

As I always say, LocalBitcoin is only one of the exchanges and for sure it's not the biggest one, but it's the one that has public stats.

I think Binance is king, it lets you go from Bolivares to any crypto.

Some common questions:

&#x200B;

* **I remember the Venezuelan currency with a lot of zeroes, what happened?** Goverment (for third time since 2008) removed 6 zeroes from the currency by law, so now 1 ""current"" Bolivar was 1,000,000 ""old"" Bs (bolivar) before OCT2021.

&#x200B;

* **Was the monthly minimum wage really 2 USD monthly?** Yes, 2 USD MONTHLY! After a increase, goverment pegged it to the national ""cryptocurrency"" the Petro, that is, as today around 28 USD. Also you get a food bonus in cash of around 10 USD. In fact, the new wage was officially set at 130 Bs. monthly (and exchange rate is 1 USD = 4.4 Bs.) that is 30 USD.

&#x200B;

* **Is that enough?** No, it is not. Some NGO say a family of 5 members need AT LEAST 500 USD monthly to ""live"".

&#x200B;

* **What is the average wage?** Some measurements puts in around 90 USD monthly. A manager could be over 200 USD monthly. That puts moons income a good chunk of money here.

&#x200B;

* **What about inflation?** Slowing down, last year was only 700%, years ago it was over 1,000,000% anually.

&#x200B;

It’s sort of a crypto coming of age story in a way. Almost, maturing. 

I’m sure with many of us, when we first got into crypto we yearned for those days that spiked. To watch the price climb 20+% in the matter of an hour. To wish for it to keep going onwards and upwards towards the moon. But those days for me have seemingly passed. 

Today, these days, I find myself almost annoyed when the price has a nice spike. Almost wanting for it to stay down just a little bit longer to further accumulate. Dips almost bringing joy so that I can stack more of those coins/tokens that I believe in. 

Been holding off from buying since pay day because I was expecting the normal weekend correction. It didn’t come. The fiat I had on the sidelines still stagnate, waiting for the correction. The old feeling of fomo beginning to inch my finger towards the buy button. 

But the correction will come. It always comes.

This is what I did, I downloaded the daily prices from BTC from March 2018 until today (March 2022), using Investing data.

That gave me around 208 weeks.

Then I checked the end price of each day (end price of ""currenct"" day means start p´rice of ""next"" day)

That gave me the following results:

|Saturday|209|125 (60%)|84 (40%)|

How to read it?

Saturday having 60% ""Gain"" means 60% of the Saturdays price ended up being higher at the end of the day than at the beggining (Friday night).

Thursday having 54% ""Loss"" means 54% of the Thursdays price ends being lower at the end of the day than tha the beggining (Wednesday night)

Don't know what to do with this info, but found it intesting. Maybe instead of daily traders we get weekly trades?

What do you think?

378,Retail and food industry blockchain adoption. Will it work?,3,tpngks,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tpngks/retail_and_food_industry_blockchain_adoption_will/,13,"We always talk use cases. What does your crypto do? You read about all these new projects and they almost all sell you the same BS. Decentralized BC with fast tx that will revolutionize the industry bla bla bla... We all know 90% of projects are garbage and will never amount to anything but I was reading an interesting article about how Blockchain can help the retail and food industry and Walmart has been at the fore front of experimentation. One example they give is how much faster (20 seconds) a certain beef or chicken that is contaminated can be tracked down to a particular farm or animal unlike the old days where it would take maybe 6 days. I call that a very useful case. Another would be better tracking of shipments and deliveries but the problem I have with all this is there is meat space involved therefore its not flawless. If humans are involved in the process it seems to me there is no immutability, It is no longer trustless or permission less. 

Vitalik Buterin has said he can see a future where elections can be held on the block chain. Interesting thought. I can see that happening although it wouldn't be easy yet would we trust the results? It would certainly have to happen in an absolute decentralized manner.

I digress and want to go back to food and retail. Currently supply chains are clogged. Is block chain helping out in any way? Does Block chain serve a farmer or a local vendor in any way to improve business, security, trust worthy ness, safety or quality? How would this impact restaurants? What about the consumer? How would /could consumers benefit from big and small companies and vendors adopting blockchain to their everyday services. I know projects like VeChain have been at this for a while but nothing new or even revolutionary has come out that I am aware of. I know the token has tanked a lot but remember the price of the token is not co related to the success of the project. 

What are your thoughts on the food and retail industry adopting blockchain?  Will it work? is it even realistic or can it be beneficial to humans? What chain would be the most ideal for all this to work?",1648398480.0

**__What is InkFinks? __**
InkFinks is a collection of 8,888 NFTs which will act as the first chapter of a larger narrative, continuously unravelling through future multimedia projects. Inspired by traditional animation and pop culture, each piece features hand-drawn traits and water-colour backgrounds painted by emerging artist, Mr. Bear. 

The Incredible World of InkFinks is a zany multimedia universe, overseen personally by its creators, Mr. Bear <a:BearWave:943353410370015233>  & The Toon Tycoon <a:TTMoney:941596264733220874>  Our past, present, and future will all be revealed through various mediums of storytelling.

“Our promise is to be unwavering in our pursuit of creating connection within our community, through high-quality art and authentic entertainment” - Mr. Bear & The Toon Tycoon, Creators of InkFinks.

The initial drop will include 8,888 generative OG InkFinks that need loving homes! 

Additionally, **The Creators will be dropping unique one-of-one (1:1) pieces at random**. As of right now, these pieces are intended to help offset our marketing and startup costs. These 1:1’s will be one-of-a-kind pieces, straight from the minds of Mr. Bear and The Toon Tycoon. Plus, you never know what sort of future use they may get you! <a:inkwink:941249606140985354>

Aside from getting to own one of the most unique, high-quality pieces of art in the NFT space, you’ll also get access to a slew of other perks!

**Hodling an InkFink NFT will be your all-access pass to the future of the brand. Owners will receive select priority access to future drops, physical sketches and gifts from The Creators, and be granted permission into a top secret channel where Mr. Bear and The Toon Tycoon will drop the alpha on all future projects. **

I'm trying to figure out if this would be something that would affect me for 2021. I was only on kraken this year. It says 2016-2020 so I assume when it goes through it would be 2021 as well. I would prefer to not let the government know I'm involved with crypto. 

So my tax report is saying I lost 800 in 2021 with 16k cost basis. Is cost basis going to be all my transactions or would the money I deposited or sent out of my wallet when leaving kraken count on transactions?

I was a little sceptical at first so only ordered a £10 PSN code. Using the crypto option gives you an extra 15% off and uses company Omnyex. After my first transaction which although doesn't match exactly 15% due to Omnyex exchange rate plus mining fee it still saves a little money and I finally get to use my Crypto for things I want. Because of this I've actually got more Crypto solely for purchasing more games in the future.


 Obviously DYOR on these sort of transactions if you decide to use it and make sure you follow the instructions given. It's all pretty straight forward.",1648403375.0

I wanted to take a minute to announce Bold, the Bitcoin Credit Card, and introduce myself to you all. We will be launching the product this year.

The idea is Bold will let you:

* Spend on a revolving USD line of credit collateralized by your bitcoin
* Avoid triggering capital gains tax
* Earn bitcoin rewards

This way you can spend dollars while you HODL.

The concept is that Bold is better than traditional credit cards because its limits are higher, rates are lower, payment terms are better, and rewards are in sats. It’s also better than bitcoin loans, because you only pay interest if you carry a balance, rather than borrowing a lump sum and paying interest on all of it starting day 1.

You unlock these benefits by posting some bitcoin as collateral.

We \*never\* rehypothecate your bitcoin collateral.

The collateral is held in a 2-of-4 multisig. You hold one key, Bold holds one key, Bold's capital partner holds one key, and there's a fourth 'safety' key held by a neutral arbitrator we hope never to touch.

Bold is a bitcoin only company. No alts.

We got some coverage in Bitcoin Magazine: [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bold-credit-card-spend-against-bitcoin-collateral](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bold-credit-card-spend-against-bitcoin-collateral)

If you're interested, you can join our waitlist at [getbold.io](https://getbold.io/).

We will be launching in the US first, followed by North America and Europe, then global.

About me: I've been a bitcoiner since the days of the Magic Internet Money Wizard, ridden the ups and downs since 2014. Bold is the credit card I've wanted for my own use. I hope you all like it too.

AMA!

118,The Best 3 Strategies to put Luna at work earning passive interest,2,tpqyr6,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tpqyr6/the_best_3_strategies_to_put_luna_at_work_earning/,23,"**Terra**’s ecosystem is booming: in this post, I'll unveil the best strategies to implement to outperform normal staking rewards.  


# Executive Summary:

\- yLuna staking on **Prism** Protocol at 9.43% APR  
\- bLuna staking on **Nexus** Protocol at 9.63% APR  
\- LunaX - Luna liquidity pool on **Stader** Labs at 19.43% APR



# First Strategy: Prism Protocol

The first strategy takes advantage of **Prism Protocol**. What is Prism?  
PRISM is a derivatives protocol that introduces new asset classes in DeFi, allowing users to manage the risks associated with volatile prices by refracting digital assets into two distinct parts: a yield component and a principal component.

For taking advantage of this, we will deposit Luna on Prism receiving a split of **pLuna and yLuna**. pLuna is our principal asset and yLuna is the yield component.

We now have two choices on what to do with our **yLuna**:

* Stake it in the yLuna **Valut**, obtaining a 9.33% APR (this way we have no exposure to PRISM)
* Swap yLuna for PRISM token and earn a base APR of 40%, with the possibility to boost the yield if locking funds.

We also have to choices with our **pLuna**:

* Swap it to yLuna to farm even more in one of the strategies above
* Put it in the liquidity pool pLuna - PRISM at a 3.33% APR



# Second Strategy: Nexus Protocol

Nexus is a Yield Optimizer and it offers liquidations protection.

The strategy comprehends swapping our Luna to bLuna. We can do so by depositing our Luna into Anchor, obtaining bLuna. Once we have done so, we can deposit out **bLuna** into the **Nexus Vault** to obtain a 9.43% APR.

What do they do with your bLuna? They take it and deposit it into Anchor as collateral, for then asking for a loan in UST at a 64% LTV and handling liquidations by front-running Oracles. Then they deposit the UST in Anchor obtaining an interest of 19.4% APR.

(The same strategy can be performed on ETH, obtaining a 6.3% APR)



# Third Strategy: LunaX on Stader Labs. (personal fav)

Stader is a Liquid Staking protocol that allows you to deposit Luna and obtain a great yield.

What we are going to do is deposit Luna and receive LunaX, an interest-bearing token with an APR of 7.78%. We are then going to put our LunaX in a pool with Luna, at a 16.37% APR paid in STD, the native token of the protocol. By doing so, our aggregate APR is around 19%.



# Executive Outro:

All of the strategies mentioned above represent higher risks than staking. You should also consider that staking your tokens helps the chain to be more secure and decentralized.  
Personally, I consider that **Liquid Staking** is a good compromise between securing the network and receiving a great yield.

This post is also available in video format [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsqIWy6Ws9k).

If you seek the highest yield, it seems that Binance offers a 18.8% APY on the three month locked staking. (Credits to u/LivingFondant1419)",1648408700.0

Although Sparrow appears to store the 12-24 standard seed words, every time you reopen your wallet file and are prompted to enter a passphrase, it regenerates the private key on the fly.

Because there’s no second confirmation of that passphrase (apart from when you first create the wallet), if you have a typo in your passphrase, you’ll end up with a completely different set of UTXOs that you may never be able to recreate again.

I found this out the hard way while setting up several new multisig wallets for friends and family. After creating the wallets, I took a break and closed Sparrow. Came back later to reopen the wallets and send small test transactions to them. With one wallet, I mistyped the passphrase and because there was no transaction history yet, it wasn’t obvious that the UTXOs weren’t right. So that’s a few sats lost to the void forever.

This isn’t meant to knock Sparrow as it has an otherwise great design and feature set. But it’s important to think of its passphrase feature as more akin to, say, Trezor Suite’s hidden wallets with the Remember option disabled, rather than being a direct equivalent to Electrum.",1648409119.0

Because there’s no second confirmation of that passphrase (apart from when you first create the wallet), if you have a typo in your passphrase, you’ll end up with a completely different set of UTXOs that you may never be able to recreate again.

681,My first DiFi transaction - I got scammed. Now staked crypto in my DeFi wallet has been unstaked and is unbonding. I have 28 days to act!,4,tprvgm,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tprvgm/my_first_difi_transaction_i_got_scammed_now/,19,"I'm fairly new to crypto and have invested a small amount on the CDC app. I also have the Crypto DeFi wallet and using Earn, staked some CRO in the wallet with a validator.

Yesterday I attempted to test the waters with some 3rd party defi apps with a small amount of crypto to learn how LP pools/farms/vaults work. To keep a long story short - *I royally fucked up* by entering my keyphrase into an external website, thus my wallet is now totally compromised and my LP tokens were lost. I got scammed. Lesson learned, I've never felt so stupid.

The scammer, now with access to my wallet, must have initiated the un-staking of the CRO I had locked in Earn in the DeFi wallet. The 28-day unbonding countdown has started.

**Is there anything I can do to 'save' my CRO that is locked in the unbonding period with the validator?**

When the 28-day unbonding period is complete, the scammer will take the remaining funds. At the exact moment the funds become unstaked, it will be a race between him and myself to transfer the funds out ASAP, which he is likely to win.

I contacted CDC support to let them know my defi wallet account is compromised. I asked if they could burn the CRO and send it to a new address, or increase/decrease the unbonding period with the validator to give me an edge. Understandably, they said no, there's nothing they can do to help. I have also reached out the validator on Telegram, but no response yet.

**Do you guys have any ideas (aside from racing the scammer on the day of unbonding) that might help me transfer those funds out safely before the scammer does in 28 days when the unbonding period completes?**",1648411245.0

The scammer, now with access to my wallet, must have initiated the un-staking of the CRO I had locked in Earn in the DeFi wallet. The 28-day unbonding countdown has started.

**Is there anything I can do to 'save' my CRO that is locked in the unbonding period with the validator?**

When the 28-day unbonding period is complete, the scammer will take the remaining funds. At the exact moment the funds become unstaked, it will be a race between him and myself to transfer the funds out ASAP, which he is likely to win.

I contacted CDC support to let them know my defi wallet account is compromised. I asked if they could burn the CRO and send it to a new address, or increase/decrease the unbonding period with the validator to give me an edge. Understandably, they said no, there's nothing they can do to help. I have also reached out the validator on Telegram, but no response yet.

**Do you guys have any ideas (aside from racing the scammer on the day of unbonding) that might help me transfer those funds out safely before the scammer does in 28 days when the unbonding period completes?**",1648411245.0

Well, to begin I start by telling him I have a bit of Bitcoin seeing everyone knows BTC. He said 'whhatt, no way, they are like thousands of dollars, how can you afford it?' Of course I tell him I can buy part of one and not a whole one. He didn't know that. He then tells his other mates about that fact and they all didn't know.

He now will put most of his next pay check in BTC (or said he will anyway). I was amazed many there didn't know it was fractionised.

### 1. Book a trip via an online travel agency
Travala.com has emerged as the leader among the handful of online booking sites that accept crypto. It may offer fewer routes and destinations than traditional air-travel sites do and sometimes list slightly higher prices, said Mr. Jovic, who recently used it to book a flight to Budapest, but he finds the ability to pay with crypto outweighs those factors. While Travala co-founder and CEO Juan Otero, who worked at Booking.com in the late 2000s, agrees his company needs to be more competitive on airfare, he argues that its luxury hotel offerings compare well to rivals’. Of Travala’s monthly active users, Mr. Otero said, an-above average number opt for “four- and five-star hotels.” Omar Hamwi, a 37-year-old crypto professional from Washington, D.C., and self-described loyal customer of Travala, booked a stay most recently at the five-star Fairmont Orchid in Hawaii. “I have idle crypto so I generally do like to use it when I can,” he said.

### 2. Buy a flight ticket directly with the airline
You can book flights directly with at least one crypto-friendly airline—AirBaltic, Latvia’s premier carrier which services more than 70 destinations, primarily in the Baltics and Europe—but if you’re not flying out of Riga, it may be hard to take advantage. Still, according to the airline, since it began accepting crypto back in 2014, more than 1,000 customers have purchased tickets that way.

### 3. Reserve a swanky hotel
The Chedi, a chic luxury resort in the Swiss Alps lets guests pay with Bitcoin or Ethereum, as long as they’re spending more than $200 when paying for rooms or services like ski rentals and spa days—easily done since room rates generally start at $650 a night. The Pavilions Hotels & Resorts, a boutique hotel group with locations in Europe and Asia including Rome, Amsterdam, Bali and Phuket, also accepts cryptocurrency bookings. For travelers who prefer to spend their crypto gains stateside, there’s the Kessler Collection, whose portfolio include several hotels in the southern U.S., as well as a ski lodge in Beaver Creek, Colo.

### 4. Visit a ‘cryptopia’
If anything close to a crypto Utopia exists, it’s the surf town of El Zonte, El Salvador, otherwise known as “Bitcoin Beach.” There, travelers can grub on pupusas after a day of surf lessons at El Zonte’s point break, and pay for it all with Bitcoin. “Most of the merchants accept Bitcoin,” said Carol Souza, a Brazilian influencer focused on educating people about crypto. Other cities are expected to follow suit. Earlier this month, the small picturesque city of Lugano, Switzerland, announced it is also adopting cryptocurrency as legal tender.",1648413634.0

Not just my friends, even my family members think that it should be banned because it is used to fund terrorism. They have no reply when I say that even normal money is used to fund terrorism. Its ridiculous. 

Just cause some people use it for the wrong purpose doesn't mean crypto technology itself is bad for society. 

Any technology that was created or will be created  will be used for bad purposes by bad people.

Not just my friends, even my family members think that it should be banned because it is used to fund terrorism. They have no reply when I say that even normal money is used to fund terrorism. Its ridiculous. 

Just cause some people use it for the wrong purpose doesn't mean crypto technology itself is bad for society. 

Any technology that was created or will be created  will be used for bad purposes by bad people.

79,Crypto can only change your life financially. It won't solve all your personal issues or make you interesting person.,0,tpsqsa,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tpsqsa/crypto_can_only_change_your_life_financially_it/,9,"I am definitely in the team  ""crypto can change my life"", but I also understand that this change will be only be about money. You can buy better clothes, sport cars,  home, retire, help your family or travel around the world thanks to profits made on crypto. Money help a lot, I believe in this too. But money are just money, they won't buy you personality.

If now you are lazy, uninteresting person that think only way to improve their life is crypto then with  money you will still be lazy, uninteresting person just rich. If you have no motivation to help people for free, throwing money around won't make them like you. If you eat fastfoods and play games most of your time, with no need to work or learn anything anymore you will become even lazier. If you don't want to go to the park with dog, you most likely won't travel anywhere. If you don't have hobbies you won't really like or be good at something just cause you can spend money on things you don't actually want.
 

 If you are ""a loser"" that count only on crypto, you most likely will be a loser even in lambo. Also probably a dick that will think is now better than everyone else. A lot of people that get rich quickly  with not much effort can't handle wealth. They waste money, they try drugs, ""pay"" others to like them and do things to prove they are interesting. Money  can change people for better, but usually it is for worse. Most lottery winners are poor after few years. 

If you can't menage your money now, eat unhealthy, play games  or watch tv whole free time, do not train, don't want to learn other languages, never spend time with family and friends, are generally boring, rude and can't  find a love interest crypto is not solution for it. Profits can help you with buying home or do not working from 9-5, but won't fix broken personality. 


Also crypto is long game. If you invest  it can took 5,10 maybe 15 years until you will become rich. And it is not guaranteed. Do not waste 10 years thinking only crypto can improve your life. Start improving your life now, so your only  problem will become lack of money. Be good, interesting and helpful person, have healthy lifestale, educate yourself, so having money won't become your only character trait if you will get lucky in crypto. If you will become rich and will spend money on sport cars or parties at least you will know it will be something you will like not a way to have some fake popularity and compensate all personal failures.",1648413785.0
